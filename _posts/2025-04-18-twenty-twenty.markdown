>*In winter the bones of the dog are drawn together: the blows of the frost make him so small*  
>*That he says, "having such a little body, I must build a stone house.*  
>*When summer comes, I will build with my claws a stone house against the cold."* 

>*(But) when summer comes, his bones expand from the relief, and his skin grows sleek,*  
>*And, when he sees himself stout, he says, "In what house should I find room, O noble sir?"*  
>*He grows stout and slinks into a shady place—a lazy, full-fed, cowardly, self-opinionated (creature)!*  
>*His heart says to him, "Build a house, O uncle!" He says, "How shall I find room in the house?”*

>*In the hour of pain the bones of your greed shrink together and diminish in compass,*  
>*And you say penitently, "I will build a house: it will be a resting-place for me in winter";*   
>*(But) when the pain is gone and your greed has grown stout, the desire for the house departs from you,  just as the dog.*

# **What Now?**
I have a list of 7 exercise-related goals for the summer, and after completing each goal, I will reflect on it here. 

**Deadlift 500 lb**

My best deadlift from standard height with a belt and straps is 452 lb (Done on February 5th). 
I am much, much weaker now, so I have some good, hard training ahead of me to reach this goal. 

**Press my bodyweight overhead**

**Squat 225 lb for 20 reps** 

**Perform 10 clean pullups**

My best press is ~50lb off my current bodyweight, easily making Goal #2 the most improbable 
on this list. To improve squatting/vertical pull strength, I plan to continue using an old 
football training program of my dad’s, which deserves its own post. 

**Run a 10k**

**Bike for 100km**

**Walk for 50km** 

These goals are all related to improving my fitness and restoring it to what it once was. 
I have neglected this aspect of training since I was in high school, and I don’t enjoy the
 feeling of being tired after climbing a flight of stairs. I have started to run recently 
 (at a snail’s pace), and I am curious how well I could improve in this training aspect.
